# first_venus_white_beam_experiment
First experiment done at VENUS to test the apertures, the beam center, repeatability of some settings...etc.

List of tasks:

* Beam profile (along xy plan, across the images) versus apertures
* Position of the center of the beam versus aperture
* Repeatability of the center position after several openings and closings of the main shutter
* Resolution vs aperture

Feel free to edit the list of tasks.
